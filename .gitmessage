#
# Conventional Commits Cheatsheet (https://www.conventionalcommits.org)
#
# <type> indicates what kind of commit this is.
# It can be one of:
#   - feat        for new features introduced (i.e. MINOR in SemVer standard)
#   - fix         for bug-fixes (i.e. PATCH in SemVer standard)
#   - build       for changes in build system or environment
#   - ci          for configuring continuous integration systems
#   - test        for adding new tests or correcting defective tests
#   - docs        for changes in documentation only
#   - refactor    for rewriting or restructuring of code that does not affect API behavior
#   - perf        for performance-enhancing refactors
#   - style       for changes in code styles and no changes in logic
#   - chore       for miscellaneous tasks
#   - revert      for reverting commits made previously
#
# <scope> describes a section of the codebase where this change is applied and is optional.
# Note that allowed content of this section depends on the specific project.
# Issue identifiers are not valid scopes.
#
# Inserting "!" before the colon indicates that this commit introduces a breaking change.
# It is equivalent to a bump in MAJOR in SemVer standard.
# With this, the breaking change indicator in <footer> becomes optional.
#
# <description> contains a conceise description of the change.
# The content should be in imperative mood, as if "This commit will..." is prepended.
# Do not capitalize the beginning of the sentence, and full stop (.) is omitted.
#
# <body> provides additional contextual information about the code changes and is optional.
# Mutliple paragraphs separated by an empty line are allowed here.
# Sentences should be in imperative mood with proper capitalization and full stops (.).
#
# <footer> is a list of key-value pairs that store "metadata" of a commit.
# There are three types of a footer:
#   - Breaking change indicator     verbatim "BREAKING CHANGE:", followed by a <description>
#   - Automatic issue management    such as "Close #123", "Reference #123", "See #123", etc.
#   - Email-like metadata           such as "Signed-off-by:", "Co-authored-by", etc.
#
# There are three exceptions to the subject line rules:
#   1. "Initial commit"     for the first commit in a git repository
#   2. "Merge branch..."    as it is the default commit message for automatic merges
#   3. "Revert..."          as it is the default commit message for reverting commits
#
#
# ODOO GUIDELINES:
#
# Tags are used to prefix your commit. They should be one of the following
#   - [FIX] for bug fixes: mostly used in stable version but also valid if you are fixing a
#       recent bug in development version;
#   - [REF] for refactoring: when a feature is heavily rewritten;
#   - [ADD] for adding new modules;
#   - [REM] for removing resources: removing dead code, removing views, removing modules, …;
#   - [REV] for reverting commits: if a commit causes issues or is not wanted reverting
#       it is done using this tag;
#   - [MOV] for moving files: use git move and do not change content of moved file otherwise
#       Git may loose track and history of the file; also used when moving code from one file
#       to another;
#   - [REL] for release commits: new major or minor stable versions;
#   - [IMP] for improvements: most of the changes done in development version are incremental
#       improvements not related to another tag;
#   - [MERGE] for merge commits: used in forward port of bug fixes but also as main commit
#       for feature involving several separated commits;
#   - [I18N] for changes in translation files;
#   - [MIG] for migrating a module;
#
# After tag comes the modified module name. Use the technical name as functional name may change with time.
# If several modules are modified, list them or use various to tell it is cross-modules.
# Unless really required or easier avoid modifying code across several modules in the same commit.
# Understanding module history may become difficult.
